# URDF_Megabot

URDF file of the **Megabot**, a large quadrupedal robot built at the ENSEIRB-MATMECA in Bordeaux. The URDF has been done using [onshape-to-robot](https://onshape-to-robot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on this CAO : [Megabot](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/2301a4283c82201cba1277f9/w/d3ded7dc03640fbfb449a82a/e/dd84e7b1d6f211ac269482ba). The geometrical loops of the robot are open in the CAO (which is needed to build an URDF file) and should be closed to simulate it.
